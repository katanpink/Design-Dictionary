                <h3>I have been studying game design for 6 years now. I have made about 15 projects in total but not a singular completed one. I primarily use C# and C++ when it comes to programming the games. When planning and idea crafting my to go client is Milanote due to it's ability to allow free form planning and orgainization to the next level. I primarily make and design platformers, fighters, and multiplayer team based games. My kickstarter to design was when I got a wii for christmas. That put me on a downwards hill as I barelled deeper into video games and fantasy storylines. It let my mind spark and allowed me to help guide programmers and artist alike to make some projects of their own.</h3>

                <h3>Creation of ideas is more than just a job, its a full expression of my abilities to produce something straight from my mind. Similar to prophet translating their messege, I have gained a lot of pride in my work and that with every improvement and stroke I itch closer to becoming the ultimate all-around master of the arts. Ever since i was a child i would always draw in my sketch book and draw. Whether it was characters from a storyline just innovated, or a real time event that if found perplexing enough to write down, I would express it through art and made me who i am today. I aim to have a grand collage of things i have created for myself and for others. That way i can look back and marvel at the process of creation that causes change and development in lives daily.</h3>
